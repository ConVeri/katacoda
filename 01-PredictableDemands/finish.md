In this scenario you learned about two ways how you can communicate application requirements to Kubernetes:

* By specifying your runtime dependencies like a ConfigMap reference. Another example would be the dependency on a PersistentVolume (which we do not have shown here)
* By setting CPU and Memory requests and limits.

Much more information for this and other patterns can be found in the [Kubernetes Patterns](https://k8spatterns.io) book. Also don't forget to check out the examples at the books' [example GitHub repository](https://github.com/k8spatterns/examples).
